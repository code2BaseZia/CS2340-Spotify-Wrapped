# Spotify-Wrapper

Originally created as a school project for CS2340 at Georgia Tech. 

In a team of five, we worked together to follow a scrum workflow and create a final working application. Complete with assigning user stories, peer programming, and standups to ultimately create and finalize our app. 

Built with Django and Tailwind. There was a web-hosted verison but due to potential server costs it has since been taken unhosted.

To see more about what the app does and how it all came together, read more about it on the [team's website](https://sites.google.com/view/2340-group-13/home).
