# Spotify-Wrapped

Originally created as a school project for CS2340 at Georgia Tech. In a team of five, we worked together to follow an Agile workflow, complete with assigning user stories, peer programming, and standups to ultimately create and finalize our app.

To see more about what the app does and how it all came together, read more about it on the [team's website](https://sites.google.com/view/2340-group-13/home).
